# Demo travel journal

## Overview
I made this solo project as a part of the Scrimba Frontend Learning path. I learned how to use React, reusable components and props in order to create the site and it was a fun idea. For those learning React, it's a good example of a way to get started in it.

## Features

It is a website that shows an example list of places travelled, and includes a link to each location in Google Maps.
